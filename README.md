âœ¨ I'm a Backend Engineer and Technical Product Lead passionate about making an impact by solving unconventional problems, advocating for building open and inclusive developer communities, and helping Startups grow.

When I'm not geeking around, coding, building communities, helping startups grow, or contributing to Open Source, you can find me geeking about Photography and wishing to explore Archery.
