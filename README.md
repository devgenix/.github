âœ¨ I'm a Backend Engineer and Cloud Developer passionate about making an impact through Code, and advocating for building open and inclusive developer communities. 

I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that by being involved in Technical Communities. I'm a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, IEEE Student Technical Branch Director and Ingressive For Good Lead Campus Ambassador. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about Photography and wishing to explore Archery.
